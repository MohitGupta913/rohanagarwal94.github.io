<p>The Barclays Premier League 2016/17 season rewinds us to the time of the Battle of PLataea when mankind witnessed one of the deadliest wars ever. With the awestrucking broadcasting deals, world’s top managers, most expensive player and Zlatan ;) at its disposal, it is more fiercer than ever before. And one not playing the official <a href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Fantasy Premier League</a> is missing out on what could be the most happening seasons the fpl managers ever played.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>There is certainly no limit to the quality that the premier league possesses this calender year proven from the fact that world class players like Negredo and Llorente are playing for bottom half teams! But as far as the bargains of the fpl is concerned, I was able to narrow down my search to a lucky number 10 so the fpl managers are able to have chance at winning the grand prize.</p>
